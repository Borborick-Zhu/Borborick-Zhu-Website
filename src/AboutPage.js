                I am a Sophomore at UCLA studying CS but I'm actually from Sydney. 
                People often have trouble pronouncing my name so just call me Bobo.

                I am super interested in the intersection between CS and Health - more notably
                how Computer Software can eventually detect early onsets of mental illness, chronic 
                illness and even heart attacks + strokes.

                Apart from coding, I love anything related to eating, cooking. If I did not code, I would
                have gone to culinary school. I also play a lot of sports which include: Ultimate Frisbee, Tennis
                Basketball, Volleyball)
